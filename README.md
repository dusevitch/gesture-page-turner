This is a quick prototype (pre-ap) to address the pain felt by musicians wanting to use digital music from a laptop, smartphone or tablet.  This computer vision app allows them to turn the page with a visible gesture.

Currently that gesture is limited to a head-nod (up and down). But future versions aim to have a self-training function where you can set your own gesture. This will hopefully also translate into gesture based scrolling as well.

TODO:
Translate into working APP for android/IOS or javascript web-app.
